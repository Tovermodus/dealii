New: Variants of SparsityTools::distribute_sparsity_pattern() and
SparsityTools::gather_sparsity_pattern() taking only the locally owned index
set of the calling MPI process have been added. They avoid the previously
necessary MPI all-to-all communication to compute the owned dofs on all
processes and instead go through Utilities::MPI::compute_index_owned with
sparse communication. On more than around 1,000 MPI ranks, the new functions
should be considerably faster.
