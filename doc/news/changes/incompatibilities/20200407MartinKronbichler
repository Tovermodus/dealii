Changed: The FETools::lexicographic_to_hierarchic_numbering() and
FETools::hierarchic_to_lexicographic_numbering() functions now take a single
integer for the degree of the associated FE_Q element and return the
numbering. The old functions taking the result array as the last argument and
the ones taking a FiniteElementData as an argument have been deprecated in
favor of the simpler setup with the degree.
